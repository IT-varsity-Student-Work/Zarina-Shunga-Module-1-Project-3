        <p>The picture quality on this TV is great. Even though it has a VA panel, it's good for co-op gaming as it has the 'Ultra Viewing Angle' layer added to it, which makes the viewing angles decent at the cost of its contrast. It's still able to produce deep blacks, but not as much as other VA panel TVs, and it has a local dimming feature to further darken any blacks. It has excellent out-of-the-box color accuracy and HDR content looks good thanks to its wide color gamut and good HDR peak brightness that makes highlights pop the way they should. Unfortunately, it has some uniformity issues as the edges of the screen are darker, but this could vary from unit to unit. If you want to place this in a bright room, it gets bright enough to combat glare and it has excellent reflection handling. All this makes it the best Samsung TV for gaming we've tested so far</p>
